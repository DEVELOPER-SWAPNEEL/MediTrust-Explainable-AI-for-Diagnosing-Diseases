## 🌍 **Overview**

> **MediTrust.AI** is an *Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)* system that diagnoses chest diseases (like **Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, or COVID-19**) from **X-ray images** and explains **why** the AI model made each prediction.

Our vision is to make AI in healthcare **trustworthy, transparent, and deployable** — bridging the gap between machine intelligence and medical expertise.

💡 *This project blends Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Explainability to revolutionize medical diagnosis.*

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

Healthcare AI models are often treated as “black boxes.”  
Doctors hesitate to trust predictions without clear explanations.

**MediTrust.AI** aims to solve this by:
- Diagnosing diseases from X-rays using AI.
- Providing **visual heatmaps (Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP)** that highlight *why* the model made each decision.
- Delivering interpretable insights for radiologists and patients.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🩺 **Disease Detection** | Identify diseases like Pneumonia or COVID-19 from X-rays. |
| 🧠 **Explainable AI** | Generate visual explanations using Grad-CAM, LIME, or SHAP. |
| 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** | Web app to upload, analyze, and view explainability reports. |
| 💾 **Model Transparency** | Side-by-side original vs explained prediction comparison. |
| ☁️ **Deployable System** | Deployable using Streamlit / Flask on cloud platforms (Render, Hugging Face Spaces, etc). |
| 🔬 **Research-Ready** | Designed for academic publication (IEEE / Elsevier scope). |

⚙️ How It Works

(Hook: Add a system diagram GIF here — data input → model → explainability → visualization)
🧠 Workflow
Upload X-Ray image via web interface.
Preprocessing (resizing, normalization).
CNN or ViT model predicts the disease.
Grad-CAM / LIME highlights key image areas influencing the decision.
Result displayed with probability and explanation heatmap.
